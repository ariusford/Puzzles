  # A draft, where there's multiple managers that must pick players to
  # make their team. Each have a turn in which they can make a pick. It
  # follows a predetermined order, so each team is assigned a position
  # from 1 to the number of team involved.
  #
  # A snake draft is a way to compensate the disavantage of being the
  # last one to pick. The manager are given a turn in the order of their
  # positions in the first pass, the this order is reversed, giving the
  # last manager two picks in a row. This is repeated as long as there
  # is an incomplete team.
  #
  # For example, in a snake draft having three teams, the positions for
  # each turn is:
  #
  #  turn:      0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9...
  #  position:  1  2  3  3  2  1  1  2  3  3...
